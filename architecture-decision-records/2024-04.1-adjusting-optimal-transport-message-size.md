# Title
Adjusting optimal transport message size.

## Description
Transport message size can have impact on delivery time in transport.

If the transport message is larger than the optimal size for the transport, such a message should be split.

It may happen that the message will be larger than the optimal transport message. In this case, the message should be added to the transport.

Very large files could tooretically be cut into small messages and filed on the inbox side. Such a solution increases the complexity of the system and won't be supported. User can attach references to the message and then consumer download a large file.
