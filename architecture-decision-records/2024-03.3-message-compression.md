# Title
Message compression

## Description
Transport messages is a collection of messages of the same type.
The structure of serialized messages is very similar.
These messages are ideal for compression, they have a lot of common parts. Compression costs some time, so it can increase latency with a small number of messages.

In the case of a large number of messages, transport bandwidth can be significantly increased and processing time reduced than processing one by one (when there are many messages to process).

The user must be able to choose the compression algorithm.

By default, messages should not be compressed.
