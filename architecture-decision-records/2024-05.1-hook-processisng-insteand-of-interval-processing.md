# Title
Hook processisng insteand of interval processing.

## Description
When a message is added to the outbox, processing task should be notified.

Currently, messages are added to the outbox, and then at intervals the task checks the messages in the outbox.

Trade-offs have to be made between database query load and message delivery latency. The parameter that is responsible for this is the time intervals between database queries.

To get rid of the compromise, we can introduce hook processing.

With the current architecture, Outbox would have to communicate over the network to Outbox Worker. Network communication is unreliable, can cause delays, and will increase the complexity of the project.

That's why it's a good idea to move the processes in the outbox worker to the outbox and create in-memory communications.

When the transaction is commited, the hook will be activated, which will start processing outbox messages within the same module.

At the very beginning there was an idea that the outbox worker could be scaled independently of the outbox service, but there is no need for this when using hook processing.

In addition, hook processing can be implemented in the inbox, since the trigger that starts the process is the message that will be received from the transport.   
Example:   
`Get messages from transport => Add messages to inbox storage => Process messages => Clean up inbox`
