Batch processing of messages

## Description
Getting of messages from storage should be processed in packets.

Then these messages should be converted to transport messages (one transport message = collection of the same messages).

Batch processing reduce number of call over the network to storage (database) and transport.

The number of transactions performed will be lower, which is also important for performance.

Batch processing is more efficient than one-by-one processing with an increasing number of messages.

User should be able to set size of batch.
