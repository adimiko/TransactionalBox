Batch processing of messages

## Description
Getting of messages from storage should be processed in packages.

Then these messages should be converted to transport messages (one transport message = collection of the same messages).

Batch processing reduce number of call over the network to storage (database) and transport.

The number of transactions performed will be lower, which is also important for performance.

Batch processing is more efficient than one by one processing with an increasing number of messages.

In contrast, this solution increases the complexity of the system. Deduplication of grouped messages is more difficult than one-by-one processing.
Furthermore, if we have large batches then when an error occurs with a write to the storage on the outbox side, the number of duplicate messages added to the transport increases.

The user must be able to set the batch size to adjust the solution to the needs of the project.
