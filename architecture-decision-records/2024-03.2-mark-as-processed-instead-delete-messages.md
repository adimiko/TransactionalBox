# Title
Mark as processed instead delete messages.

## Description
Messages can be deleted after processing from Outbox or Inbox.

However, this method does not allow the processed messages to be archived.
In addition, mostly deletion operations are slower than updating, which can increase the processing time of messages.

It is better to mark messages as processed than to delete them immediately, because you can delegate this process and delete messages in larger batches.
