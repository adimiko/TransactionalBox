# Title
Main namespace

## Description
All public classes and interfaces used by the user should be in the `TransactionalBox` namespace. The exception is classes or interfaces that are included as parameters in extension methods.

Ensures the ergonomic use of packages.

Example:   
 If a user adds a package with Entity Framework, it not need to add new namespace to use the extension method.

Sometimes IntelliSense does not suggest which namespace to use for extension methods.
