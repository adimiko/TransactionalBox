##### :star: - The star motivates me a lot!   

</div>


### :fire: Examples of network communication problems
-  **Lost message**

*Amount was taken from bank account and transfer was never executed.*

- **The same message was processed again**

*Transfer was ordered and amount was debited from bank account twice.*

- **Unavailable service**

*Transfer order attempt fails.*

### :star2: Benefits
- **Easy To Use**
    - *Quick learning and low entry threshold*
    - *Configured by default to prevent overwhelm for beginners*
    - *Add message to outbox and then appears in inbox handler*
- **Eventual Consistency**
    - *Outbox sends a message at least once*
    - *Inbox deduplicates the message and processes exactly once*
- **Scalability & Fault Tolerance**
    - *Retry pattern with delay*
    - *Multiple instances of the same service (distributed processing)*
- **Highly Configurable & Extendable**
    - *Components are configurable via settings*
    - *Extendable with new transport and storage providers*
- **Reduce Latency & Increase Bandwidth**
    - *Hook processing (instead of interval processing)*
    - *Compression algorithms*
    - *Grouping messages by type to transport message (better compression)*
    - *Adjusting optimal transport message size*

</h3>

> [!NOTE]
> Docker is required.

Clone this repo and open `TransactionalBox.sln` via Visual Studio 2022. Set the `TransactionalBox.Sample.WebApi` as startup and then run. You should see the following view.

*Project is at an early stage of life cycle, if you find some bug, let me know* :telephone:.   

Have fun :smiley:!

## :european_castle: Architecture
The transactional box consists of two basic components.
The following diagrams show the basic flow (omits details).
They are designed to provide a general understanding of how transactional box works.

### Outbox
The outbox is responsible for adding messages to the storage and then adding at least once to the transport.

</div>

### Inbox 
The inbox is responsible for getting messages from the transport and adding them to the storage, and then processes these messages.

## :world_map: Roadmap
Name of **TransactionalBox** fits perfectly with the future of the project. It will be possible to use different `transactional boxes`. 

### Outbox and Inbox

`No guarantee of message order between services.`

Implementation under the competition.

*e.g. Payment service asynchronously sends notification of payment to user.*

Improvements:
- Code refactor
- More tests
- Support for more storage providers (e.g. MongoDB, Marten)
- Support for more transport providers (e.g. Iggy, RabbitMq, HTTP, gRPC)
- Performance optimization

### StreamOubox and StreamInbox

`Guarantee of message order in stream between services.`

**Idea**  
Ensuring the order of messages within a stream. Messages are sent by StreamOutbox and the order is respected in StreamInbox. Transport provider does not have to support message order.

*e.g. (CQRS Pattern) When transfer is made in the write service, the event asynchronously refreshes the account balance in the read service.*

### InternalBox

`Guarantee of message order in stream inside the service.`

**Idea**   
Ensuring the order of messages within a stream insite the service. Messages are added to storage provider and then processed. Transport provider is unnecessary.

*e.g. Asynchronous internal communication between Aggregate Roots using domain events in the same service.*
