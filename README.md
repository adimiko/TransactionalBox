:star: - The star motivates me a lot!   

`TransactionalBox` is an implementation of the outbox and inbox pattern in .NET.   
Ensures eventual consistency when modules need to communicate with each other over the network.

Examples of problems that occur during network communication:
- lost messages
- the same messages were processed again
- unavailable services

## âœ¨ Features
#### Actions
- [x] Add a message to send to the outbox
- [ ] Add a message to publish to the outbox
- [x] Get messages from outbox and add them to transport
- [x] Get a message from transport and add them to the inbox
- [x] Get a message from inbox and process it

#### Storage
- [x] Support for Entity Framework
    - [x] Support for EF Migrations

## :clapper: Run Sample
> [!NOTE]
> Docker is required.

Clone this repo and open `TransactionalBox.sln` via Visual Studio 2022. Set the `TransactionalBox.Sample.WebApi` as startup and then run. You should see the following view.

Have fun :smiley:!

## :european_castle: Architecture
The transactional box consists of four basic components.
The following diagrams show the basic flow (omits details).

### Outbox
Outbox is responsible for adding messages to the storage.
